# Full-Stack React Projects
This is the code repository for [Full-Stack React Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/full-stack-react-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788835534), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book explores the potential of developing full-stack JavaScript web applications by combining the power of React with industry tested server-side technologies, such as Node, Express, and MongoDB. The JavaScript landscape has been growing rapidly for some time now. With an abundance of options and resources available on this subject matter, it is easy to get lost when you need to choose from these frequently changing parts, learn about them, and make them work together to build your own web applications. In an attempt to address this pain point, the book adopts a practical approach to help you set up and build a diverse range of working applications using this popular JavaScript stack.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import path from 'path'
const CURRENT_WORKING_DIR = process.cwd()
app.use('/dist', express.static(path.join(CURRENT_WORKING_DIR, 'dist')))
```

The content in this book is organized with the assumption that you have familiarity with basic web-based technologies, a working knowledge of programming constructs in JavaScript, and a general idea of how React applications work. As you go through the book, you will uncover how these concepts come together when building full-fledged web applications with React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

In order to maximize your learning experience while reading through the chapters, it is recommended that you run the associated version of the application code in parallel, using the relevant instructions provided in each chapter.
